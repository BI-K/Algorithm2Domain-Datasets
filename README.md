## Work in progress
Algorithm2Domain is  a meta-repository for benchmarking of domain adaptation performance managed by [NFDI4DataScience](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/) consortium and the [Institute for Biomedical Informatics](https://bik.uni-koeln.de/) (University Hospital of Cologne).
Our goal is to aggregate existing algorithms and benchmarking suits, and develop integrative pipelines for mix-and-match cross-domain benchmarking. The data sources suitable for the benchmarking will be aggregated as pointers. 

This repository acts as a databse for datasets useful for benchmarking domain adaptation algorithms. Apart from providing an overview over suitable benchmark datasets and the way they have been used to assess domain adaptation, dataset-sepcific scripts that preparet hem for the benchmark suites supported by Algorithm2Domain are provided here.
